# Airplane Ticket Discount System

## Problem Statement

The aim of this project is to apply dynamic discounts to airplane tickets. In today's competitive market, offering discounts is crucial to attract customers and increase sales. However, applying discounts dynamically based on various factors can be complex.

## Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

Our solution stands out through its utilization of design patterns such as **Chain of Responsibility**, **Singleton**, and **Builder**. We've implemented these patterns to create a robust and flexible system, entirely based on an object-oriented approach.

## Features

- **Dynamic Discounting**: The system dynamically applies discounts to airplane tickets based on various factors such as booking time, destination, customer loyalty, etc.
  
- **Chain of Responsibility**: We've implemented the Chain of Responsibility pattern to handle discount requests in a decoupled and efficient manner. Each handler in the chain has a specific responsibility, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.
  
- **Singleton**: The Singleton pattern ensures that there's only one instance of the discount manager throughout the application, preventing unnecessary resource consumption and ensuring consistency.
  
- **Builder**: Utilizing the Builder pattern, we've simplified the construction of complex discount rules. The builder encapsulates the logic for creating discount objects, promoting code readability and maintainability.

## Usage

To use this system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Build and run the application.
3. Follow the instructions provided to input ticket details and obtain discounted prices.
